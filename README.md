# Modified-MNIST-Image-Classification

In this project we performed a supervised prediction task on the Modified-MNIST
dataset, which is a more challenging variant of the original MNIST. Our goal was
to output the digit in the image with the highest numeric value. We developed
convolutional neural network architectures for our model and also used famous
image classification models: VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet-50. Also in some
models we used methods such as data augmentation to further improve the accuracy.
We obtained the best performance with VGG16 network with a validation accuracy
of 99.03% and an accuracy of 98.933% on Kaggle test set.
